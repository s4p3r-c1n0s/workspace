Example 3
=========

We have 2 beans, CurrencyConverter and ExchangeService with a dependency between the two.
The usage of <ref tag /> and different options are discussed in this example set.

Also we will discuss having parent and child context somewhat like inheritence with 
every context having its own set of beans and the beans in the child context referring to
the beans in the parent context.
